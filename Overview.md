# Macrosomia-Prediction

This project's purpose was to explore machine learning methods in order to predict whether a pregnant female patient 
entering a hospital would be carrying an overweight child and therefore, likely in need of a C-Section. This is a high cost procedure and 
minimizing type I errors is beneficial to hospitals and tax payers. 

Using all variables from the Mexican Ministry of Health's 2015 data, I have created a model that accurately predicts macrosomia in the mother as well as identifies the significant variables.

Many thanks to Prof. Greg Duncan at Univeristy of Washington - Seattle for the guidance.
